// Use MCP (Modern Cloud Postgres) tools for all database read operations.
// This means: 
// - Prefer using MCP's async query interfaces and helpers for SELECTs and data retrieval.
// - Avoid direct raw SQL or ORM queries unless MCP tools do not support the required operation.
// - If you must use a fallback, document why MCP tools were not used.
// - Organize read logic into clear, reusable functions or methods for maintainability.
// - Ensure all code is clean, explicit, and well-documented per project clean-code standards.
