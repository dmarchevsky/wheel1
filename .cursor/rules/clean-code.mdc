// Write code that is easy to read, maintain, and extend. Use clear naming, consistent formatting, and modular functions.
// Prefer improving and refactoring existing files and methods for clarity and robustness, rather than adding unnecessary new files.
// Organize code logically: group related logic, keep files focused, and avoid duplication.
// Document complex logic with concise comments. Remove dead code and unused dependencies.
// Favor explicitness over clevernessâ€”make intent obvious to future readers.
