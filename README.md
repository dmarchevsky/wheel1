```

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup**:

   cd wheel1
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

2. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   just dev
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Web Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
   - API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

4. **Setup Telegram Bot**:
   - Send `/start` to your bot
   - Use `/recs` to see current recommendations
   - Use `/positions` to view holdings

## Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Required API Keys - Production
TRADIER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_tradier_token
TRADIER_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id

# Optional - Sandbox Trading Environment
TRADIER_SANDBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_sandbox_token
TRADIER_SANDBOX_ACCOUNT_ID=your_sandbox_account_id

# Database

```

### Trading Environments

The application supports both **Production** and **Sandbox** trading environments:

- **Production**: Uses live Tradier account for real trading (always required)
- **Sandbox**: Uses Tradier paper trading for testing (optional)

**Environment Switching:**
- Toggle between environments using the switch in the app header
- Production mode: Green indicators and standard theme
- Sandbox mode: Orange indicators and amber-tinted theme for safety
- Market data always comes from production for accuracy
- Account operations (positions, orders) respect the selected environment

**Setup Sandbox (Optional):**
1. Create a [Tradier Developer Account](https://developer.tradier.com)
2. Get sandbox API credentials
3. Add `TRADIER_SANDBOX_*` variables to your `.env` file
4. Switch to sandbox mode in the UI for safe testing

**Sandbox Behavior:**
- Sandbox APIs may have limited data or occasional unavailability
- When sandbox APIs fail, the app shows clear error messages
- No mock/fake data is displayed - only real API responses or empty states
- API errors are logged and displayed to help with debugging

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
just test

# Lint code
just lint

# Seed database
just seed

# Export data
just export
```

## Trading Strategy

The Wheel Strategy involves:

2. **Assignment Management**: If assigned, hold the stock
3. **Covered Calls**: Sell calls against owned shares for additional income
4. **Rolling**: Adjust positions based on market conditions
